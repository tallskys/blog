Horror has always had a complex relationship with grief. When most people think of horror movies they think of slashers, those films where sexually vivacious teens get slaughtered by a masked assailant in the woods. In these types of movies, grief is ignored entirely, glossed over by the thrill of what may come next in the movie for our unfortunate teens. We don't see the All-Star QB who was gored by a fence post get a funeral, or a heartfelt eulogy from his brother, we never see mourning.

For anyone who has experienced the loss of someone close to them, you know that death is a prism, whatever your life was when it hits that point, whatever comes out the other side won't be the same, and it never can be the same again. Despite all of horror's shortcomings in some of it's messier sub-genres like the slashers above, I believe horror is better equipped to gracefully handle how the human mind grapples with grief than any other genre.

Take a movie like Lake Mungo, as haunting a meditation on grief as you'll find, that follows a family shortly after the drowning of their daughter. It takes an unflinching and often uncomfortably intimate look at how we all deal with death in our own unique ways, and the oongoing damage some of those things can cause. The Mother of the story refuses to look at her child's body, which then allows her to believe the ghost stories her son starts telling her. The son starts dressing as his late sister and wandering around town, showing up in pictures and stoking his mother's conspiracies further. The Father, the only one who saw the body, is world weary, but trying to be supportive. It's a startling look at how grief can splinter a once nuclear unit, and how much stronger those bonds can be once the pain is worked through.

The horror genre may not always gracefully handle death, in fact it often treats it as an amusement and nothing else. But when it decides to examine the repercussions of death, it becomes the most potent conveyor of emotions. It shows you how to look back at that prism, that moment in time when everything changed, shows you how to examine it with different eyes, and tells you to grow.
