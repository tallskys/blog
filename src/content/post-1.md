Horror has always had a complex relationship with grief. When most people think of horror movies they think of slashers, those films where sexually vivacious teens get slaughtered by a masked assailant in the woods. In these types of movies, grief is ignored entirely, glossed over by the thrill of what may come next in the movie for our unfortunate teens. We don't see the All-Star QB who was gored by a fence post get a funeral, or a heartfelt eulogy from his brother, we never see mourning.

For anyone who has experienced the loss of someone close to them, you know that death is a prism, whatever your life was when it hits that point, whatever comes out the other side won't be the same, and it never can be the same again. Despite all of horror's shortcomings in some of it's messier sub-genres like the slashers above, I believe horror is better equipped to gracefully handle how the human mind grapples with grief than any other genre.

Take a movie like Lake Mungo, as haunting a meditation on grief as you'll find, that follows a family shortly after the drowning of their daughter. It takes an unflinching and often uncomfortably intimate look at how we all deal with death in our own unique ways, and the ongoing damage some of those things can cause. The mother of the story refuses to look at her daughter's body, which then allows her to believe that the apparitions that start showing up in pictures are her daughter, still alive. The son starts dressing as his late sister and wandering around town, showing up in pictures and stoking his mother's conspiracies further. The father, the only one who saw the body, is world weary, but trying to be supportive. It's a startling look at how grief can splinter a once nuclear unit, and how much stronger those bonds can be once the pain is worked through.

And then there's the Friday the 13th series. The number of different ways that people die in these movies is frankly wild. It's a series that prided itself on constantly outdoing each past iteration with new and gnarly variations on ending a human life. There's garden shears, machetes (obviously), guitars, and tents, just to rattle off a few memorable ones. Grief is not one of the tools used in these movies. Grief is an afterthought. There's a character who spends one entire movie hunting down Jason for murdering his sister in a the previous movie, and when he catches Jason, he's brutally killed in seconds and then never revisited. That's probably as close to dipping into grief as these movies get, and they battered it with garden utensils and left it for dead.

Somewhere between these two on the emotional spectrum is The Babadook. A film that frames a a single mother dealing with a difficult child in the aftermath of her husband dying in a car crash. Her inability to handle her grief and also her hellion child manifests itself in a literal monster - a shadowy creature that possesses her and causes her to violently attack her son. This is a film that, for a bit, gives those feelings of loss and being overwhelmed a tangible shape, dark and malovelent.

The horror genre may not always gracefully handle death, in fact it often treats it as an amusement and nothing else. But when it decides to examine the repercussions of death, it becomes the most potent conveyor of emotions. It shows you how to look back at that prism, that moment in time when everything changed, shows you how to examine it with different eyes, and tells you to grow.
