I'm going to use this space to post some things I've read over the last week because 1) it's my site and nobody is reading this anyways and I can do what I want 2) it will keep me honest and force me to keep reading and 3) it will make me post on here. So here goes.

Here's a list of some good books that are centered on the theme of not getting any sleep, as a sufferer of insomnia, I feel this in my bones:

An excerpt from Lynda Barry's new book 'Making Comics'. Some really good stuff, but my favorite line is at the end "You don't have to have any artistic skill to do this, you just need to be brave and sincere."

A short little video demoing GraphiQL Spark. Egghead is good, GraphQL is good, this is good.

A rare list where I got the validation of having read some of these and also got some new things to add to my reading list.
